## Installation Instructions
1. Extract all zipped files into your FFXINA folder.
1.1 You can get to this folder easily from Steam by right clicking on FFXI and selecting "Browse Local Files".
2. Set the launch option to: "PATH TO YOUR GAME INSTALL HERE\FFXINA\FFXI Steam Playtime Tracking Fixer.exe" %command%
replacing "PATH TO YOUR GAME INSTALL HERE" with the path to your FFXINA folder. 
2.1 The default path is "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\FFXINA\FFXI Steam Playtime Tracking Fixer.exe" but if you have it on a different drive you will need to adjust the path.
